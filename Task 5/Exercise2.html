    <td style="position: absolute ;margin-top:10px;"><span >My dog Sasha is my best friend. She likes to chase the soccer ball when I practice. <br>
        It is so funny to see her running down the field trying to catch the ball with her mouth. <br> It just won't fit !</span></td>

    <p>Once Sasha saved my life. When I was only 4 years old, I started to go into the strest to get a ball that had rolled across the street. <br> Of course I did not think to look for cars! Sasha got in front of me and knocked me backwards onto the sidewalk.
      <br>   I was mod until I saw the car go by where I would have been. Then I was so happy that Sasha was smarter than I was</p>
